 *Your Life in numbers* is a command-line interface program whose main goal is to provide the user with some facts based on the user's age, sex, height, weight and habits.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to save and store the files for the website.
- [Lucid](https://lucid.app/) was used to create the Flowchart.
- [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) was used to create the gradient background of the instruction button
- [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used to display the website on different devices.
- [beautifier](https://beautifier.io/) to beautify the code
- [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) was used to check the grammar and spelling in the README. 

## Testing

1. **Validator Testing**

- **[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)**

  - result for index.html<br>
    ![HTML final result]()<br>
   
I also checked the page in the validator via text-input, and likewise no errors were detected in this way. All I got was information to avoid trailing slashes in void elements.

2. **Lighthouse Test** <br>
   To measure the website against performance, accessibility, SEO and best practice, I used [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=de).<br>
   - result for index.html<br>
   First, it gave a warning that the form element did not have the correct associated label. 
   ![Lighthouse]()

3. **Manual testing** <br>
To ensure the pages are responsive, I used the Google Chrome developer tools.

| **Test** | **Test Description** | **Expected Outcome** | **Result**|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|


4. **Browser Compatibility**<br>
  The tests were conducted using the following browsers:
